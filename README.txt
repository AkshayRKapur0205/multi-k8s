Kubernetes Code Deployment System README
Overview
This README provides an overview of the Kubernetes-based code deployment system, leveraging Docker, Travis CI, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) for automatic testing and deployment.

Components:
Docker: Docker is used for containerization, ensuring consistency and portability across environments.
Kubernetes: Kubernetes is utilized for container orchestration, managing the deployment, scaling, and operation of containerized applications.
Travis CI: Travis CI is employed for continuous integration, automating the testing process whenever code changes are pushed to the master branch.
Google Cloud Platform (GCP): GCP is used for hosting and managing the Kubernetes cluster and associated resources.
Setup Instructions
Follow these steps to set up the Kubernetes-based code deployment system:

1. Docker Setup:
Install Docker on your development machine.
Dockerize your application by creating Dockerfiles for each service.
Build Docker images for your services using docker build -t <image_name> ..
2. Kubernetes Setup:
Set up a Kubernetes cluster on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) using Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE).
Deploy your Dockerized application to the Kubernetes cluster.
Define Kubernetes deployment manifests (Deployment, Service, etc.) for each service in your application.
3. Travis CI Setup:
Sign in to Travis CI with your GitHub account.
Enable the repository where your code is hosted.
Create a .travis.yml file in the project root directory to configure the CI process.
Configure Travis CI to build Docker images and run tests on every push to the master branch.
4. Google Cloud Platform Setup:
Set up a project on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) if you haven't already.
Create a Kubernetes cluster using Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE).
Configure kubectl to connect to your GKE cluster.
Apply Kubernetes manifests to deploy your application to the cluster.
Usage
Once the setup is complete, the Kubernetes-based code deployment system will automatically trigger the following workflow:

Push Code Changes: Push code changes to the master branch.
Travis CI Testing: Travis CI will detect the changes, pull the code, build Docker images, and run tests.
Automatic Deployment: Upon successful testing, Travis CI will trigger Kubernetes deployments to update the application running on the GKE cluster.
Additional Notes
Monitor Travis CI builds and Kubernetes deployments for any errors or issues.
Ensure proper security measures are in place for GCP resources, including IAM roles, network policies, and access controls.
Regularly update dependencies and configurations to maintain system stability and security.
